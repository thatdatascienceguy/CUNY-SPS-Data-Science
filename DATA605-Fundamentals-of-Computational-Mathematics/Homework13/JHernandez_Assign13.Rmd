1. Use integration by substitution to solve the integral below

$\int 4e^{-7x} \,dx$

Answer:

- let $u = -7x$
- $\,du/\,dx = -7$
- $\,du = -7 \,dx$
- $\,dx = -\,du/7$

- Rewrite the integral as

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int (-4/7) e^{u} \,du \\
= (-4/7) e^u + C \\
= (-4/7) e^{-7x} + C
\end{aligned}
$$

2. Biologists are treating a pond contaminated with bacteria. The level of contamination is
changing at a rate of $\,dN/\,dt = -3150/t^4 - 220$ bacteria per cubic centimer per day,
where t is the number of days since treatment began. Find a function $N(t)$ to estimate the level
of contamination if the level after 1 day was 6530 bacteria per cubic centimeter.

Answer:

- We are given the initial condition $N(1) = 6530$
- To find $N(t)$ in general, we have to integrate the equation and solve for the arbitrary constant C to
get the general closed form solution $N(t)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
N(t) = \int \,dN/\,dt \,dt \\
= \int (-3150/t^4 - 220) \,dt \\
= 1050/t^3 - 200t + C
\end{aligned}
$$

- To find C, we can use the given initial condition $N(t=1)$ and solve for C

$$
\begin{aligned}
N(1) = 6530 = 1050 - 200 + C \\
C = 5680 \\
thus \\
N(t) = 1050/t^3 - 200t + 5680
\end{aligned}
$$

3. Find the total area of the red rectangles in the figure below, where the equation of the
line is $f(x) = 2x-9$

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("homework13_3.png", dpi=0.001)
```

Answer:

- By looking at the width of each triangle using the grid lines as a guide, we see
that the width of all 4 triangles is 1 unit and the length of each rectangle from
left to right respectively is 1,3,5 and, 7 units.

    Area of the first rectangle = 1*1 = 1
    
    Area of the second rectangle = 1*3 = 3
    
    Area of the third rectangle = 1*5 = 5
    
    Area of the fourth rectangle = 1*7 = 7

- Add them all up and the total area of the rectangles is 16.

4. Find the area of the region bounded by the graphs of the given equations.

$y = x^2 - 2x - 2, y = x + 2$

Answer:

- To compute the area we need to first know what values of x do they both meet at;
we can do this by setting them equal to each and solve for x.

- Solving for x gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
x + 2 = x^2 -2x - 2 \\
x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \\
(x-4)(x+1) = 0 \\
x=4, x = -1
\end{aligned}
$$

- Now that we have the endpoints, we can compute and plot or graph the two functions
and see that $x+2 \geq x^2-2x-2$ for all x $\epsilon [-1,4]$.

- Both functions are continous everywhere in the region and we can find the area between curves as

- $\int^{4}_{-1} (x+2 - (x^2-2x-2)) \,dx$ Solving the integral gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int^{4}_{-1} (x+2 - (x^2-2x-2)) \,dx \\
= \int^{4}_{-1} -x^2 + 3x + 4 \,dx \\
= \big[-x^3/3 + 3x^2/2 + 4x\big]^4_{-1} \\
= -64/3 + 24 + 16 - (1/3 + 3/2 - 4) \approx 20.833
\end{aligned}
$$

5. A beauty supply store expects to sell 110 flat irons during the next year. It costs $3.75 
to store one flat iron for one year. There is a fixed cost of $8.25 for each order. Find the
lot size and number of orders per year that will minimize inventory costs.

Answer:

- This is a optimization problem where we need to find the number of orders and number of irons
to minimize costs.
- let r be the number of orders and let f be the number of flat irons.
- We are given the cost function
$Cost = c(r,f) = 3.75f + 8.25r$
- We are also given the expected value of flat irons to sell: 110 which can be re-written as
$rf = 110$
- This is because we can get 110 flat irons by not just doing one order in bulk but in several orders.
- We solve for $f = 110/r$
- We now can write the cost function as a single variable c(r) and compute c`(r) and set it to zero
to find the critical value r that minimizes c(r) that is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
c(r) = 3.75(110/r) + 8.25r \\
= 412.5/r + 8.25r \\
c^{`}(r) = -412.5/r^2 + 8.25 \\
0 = -412.5/r^2 + 8.25 \\
r^2 = 412.5/8.25 = 50 \\
r = \sqrt{50}
\end{aligned}
$$

- With r found, we can go back to the equation $f = 110/r$ and solve for f.
$f = 110/\sqrt{50}$

- Thus the number of flat irons to store is about ceil($\sqrt{50}$) $\approx 8$ and
the number of orders to put in is about ceil($110\sqrt{50}$) $\approx 16$

6. Use integration by parts to solve the integral below
$\int ln(9x) x^6 \,dx$

Answer: 

- Integration by parts is as follows, given two functions $f(x), g(x)$, 
$\int f(x)g^{`}(x) \,dx = f(x)g(x)- \int f^{`}(x)g(x) \,dx$

- commonly the formula is written down as
$\int u\,dv = uv-\int v\,du$ where $u=f(x), v=g(x), du = f^{`}(x) \,dx, dv = g^{`}(x) \,dx$

- let $u = ln(9x)$ and $dv = x^6$, then $du = 1/9x \,dx$ and $v = x^7/7 \,dx$ so

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int u\,dv = uv-\int v\,du \\
= (x^7\ln(9x))/7 - \int (x^7/7) (1/9x) \,dx \\
= (x^7\ln(9x))/7 - \int x^6/63 \,dx \\
= (x^7\ln(9x))/7 - x^7/441 + C \\
= x^7(63\ln(9x)- 1)/441 + C
\end{aligned}
$$

7. Determine whether f9x) is a probability density function on the interval $[1, e^6]$.
If not, determine the value of the definite integral.

$f(x) = 1/6x$

Answer:

- Compute $\int^{e^6}_{1} 1/6x \,dx$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int^{e^6}_{1} 1/6x \,dx = \big[\ln(6x) \big]^{e^6}_1 \\
= \ln(6e^6) - \ln(6) \\
\ln(6) + \ln(e^6) - \ln(6) = 6 \neq 1
\end{aligned}
$$

- This shows the given limits don't compute to 1 which is what is needed to make this a valid
probability density function.
