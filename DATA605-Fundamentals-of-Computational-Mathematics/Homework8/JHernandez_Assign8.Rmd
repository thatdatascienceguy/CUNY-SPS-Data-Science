### 11. A company buys 100 lightbulbs, each of which has an exponential lifetime of 1000 hours. 

### What is the expected time for the first of these bulbs to burn out?

We are given the expected lifetime of a bulb is 1000 hours = $\mu$

let $X_i$ be the independent random variable for light bulb i.

then the $X_i$'s all follow a exponential distribution with rate parameter $\lambda_i$

Expected value for light bulb i: $E[X_i] = \mu = 1000 = 1/\lambda_i$ so $\lambda_i = 1/1000$

summing up the lambda values (they're all equal) gives $100*\lambda = 100* (1/1000) = 1/10$

we can use the updated $\lambda$ value that is the sum of all lambda values and show that 

the expected time is $E[min(X_1,x_2,...X_100)] = 1/(1/10) = 10 hours.

### Exercise 14 (from Section 7.2) Assume that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent random variables, each having an

### exponential density with parameter $\lambda$. Show that $Z = X_1 - X_2$ has density

### $f_Z(z) = (1/2)\lambda e^{-\lambda |z|}$

Using convolution we are going to compute the difference of two expoential distributions

note that $f_{X_1}(x_1) = f_{X_2}(x_1) = \lambda e^{-\lambda z}$ for $x_1 \geq 0$ and 0 otherwise.

First, we can rewrite Z as $Z = X_1 + (-X_2)$ and set $-X_2 = Z - X_1$

The convolution of $X_1$ and $-X_2$ is 

1. $f_Z(z) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{X_1}(x_1) f_{-X_2}(z-x_1) dx_1$

note that $f_{-X_2}(Z - X_1) = f_{X_2}(X_1 - Z)$ (switch the signs)

That is 
$$
\begin{aligned}
f_Z(z) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{X_1}(x_1) f_{X_2}(x_1-z) dx_1 = \\
\text{we set the limits in the integral from 0 to positive infinity)} \\
\int_{0}^{\infty} \lambda e^{-\lambda x_1} \lambda e^{-\lambda (x_1-z)}dx_1 = \\
\lambda^2 \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\lambda(2x_1-z)} dx_1 = \\
\lambda^2 \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{\lambda z} e^{-2\lambda x_1} dx_1 = \\
\lambda^2 e^{\lambda z}\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-2\lambda x_1} dx_1 = \\
\lambda^2 e^{\lambda z}\big[-(1/2)e^{-2\lambda x_1}\big]_{0}^{\infty} = \\
(1/2)\lambda e^{\lambda z}
\end{aligned}
$$
Through this long exercise we notice that when $z < 0$, we get $f_Z(z)=(1/2)\lambda e^{-\lambda z}$

and for $z \geq 0$, we get $f_Z(z)=(1/2)\lambda e^{\lambda z}$ we can use the absolute value of z as

$f_Z(z) = f_Z(-z)$ that is $f_Z(z)=(1/2)\lambda e^{-\lambda |z|}$ which is a distrubution for all z.

### Exercise 1 (from Section 8.2): Let X be a continuous random variable with mean $\mu = 10$ and variance

### $\sigma^2 = 100/3$. Using Chebyshevâ€™s Inequality, find an upper bound for the following 

### probabilities:

(a) $P(|X - 10| \geq 2)$

(b) $P(|X - 10| \geq 5)$

(c) $P(|X - 10| \geq 9)$

(d) $P(|X - 10| \geq 20)$


(From the textbook which will be used to solve these exercises)

(Chebyshev Inequality) Let X be a continuous random variable

with density function $f(x)$. Suppose X has a finite expected value $\mu = E(X)$ and

finite variance $\sigma^2 = V(X)$. Then for any positive number $\epsilon > 0$ we have

$P(|X - \mu| \geq \epsilon) \leq \sigma^2/\epsilon^2$

a) $\epsilon = 2$ and the upper bound is $\sigma^2/\epsilon^2 = (100/3)/4 = 25/3$

b) $\epsilon = 5$ and the upper bound is $\sigma^2/\epsilon^2 = (100/3)/25 = 4/3$

However for a) and b), the upper bound is greater than 1 which cannot be true for

a probability value. Hence the upper bound is 1.

c) $\epsilon = 9$ and the upper bound is $\sigma^2/\epsilon^2 = (100/3)/81 = 100/243$

d) $\epsilon = 20$ and the upper bound is $\sigma^2/\epsilon^2 = (100/3)/400 = 1/12$
